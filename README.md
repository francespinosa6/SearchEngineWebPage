# GIF Hunter

<h2>Name: Francisco J. Espinosa-Castillo</h2></br>
<h4>Description: This project consists of a webpage with a search engine that retrieve gifs from a gif library through an API key provided by GIPHY developers.
The data retrieved is parsed from JSON to an object to be able to manipulate the data with javascript and Jquery. It is also made responsive to small and big screens using Bootstrap's grid and CSS</h4></br>
<b>How to use it:</b> Enter a word, or phrase in the search field and click the search button. You will see a list of 50 gifs regarding your search. If you minimize the screen, you can also see how the webpage is responsive to it, either staying statically or stacking the elements up in form of a list. The gifs are going to be displayed depending on the screen size, ranging from 1 to 6 columns. The description paragraph at start disappears when a query is done, and an alert message pops out when the search button is clicked without any input. You can reset everything by clicking the webpage title.</br>
<b>Technologies:</b> HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JQuery, Javascript and Github.</br>
<b>Future ideas for improvement:</b></br> 1- Display gif examples at start </br>
2-Create a menu that when in small device screens, the menu serves as a list of the different options on the page</br>
3-Create an about me page,and 2 or more pages of relevance to the topic.</br>
4-Access to videos as well
